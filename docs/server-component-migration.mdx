# Server Component Migration Guide

This document outlines components that could be migrated from Client Components to Server Components to improve performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.

## Benefits of Server Components

1. **Reduced Client-Side JavaScript** - Server Components don't ship any JavaScript to the client
2. **Improved Performance** - Initial page load is faster without client-side hydration
3. **Direct Backend Access** - Server Components can directly access backend resources
4. **Automatic Code Splitting** - Client Components are automatically code-split

## Components to Consider for Migration

### High Priority

These components have minimal interactivity and would benefit most from being Server Components:

1. **`components/category-grid.tsx`**
   - Primarily displays static data
   - No user interactions except links
   - Could fetch category data server-side

2. **`components/how-it-works.tsx`**
   - Static content with no interactivity
   - Perfect candidate for a Server Component

3. **`app/about/page.tsx`**
   - Static content page
   - No client-side interactivity

4. **`app/faq/page.tsx`**
   - Currently uses client-side for Accordion
   - Could be refactored to use a Server Component with a Client Component for just the Accordion

### Medium Priority

These components have some interactivity but could be split into Server and Client parts:

1. **`components/featured-listings.tsx`**
   - Data fetching could be moved to the server
   - Only the favorite button needs to be a Client Component
   - Use a pattern where the main component is a Server Component with Client Component islands

2. **`app/listings/page.tsx`**
   - Initial data fetch could be server-side
   - Filter UI would remain client-side
   - Split into Server Component for initial render and Client Components for interactive parts

3. **`components/similar-listings.tsx`**
   - Similar to featured-listings, data fetching could be server-side
   - Only interactive elements would be Client Components

### Low Priority

These components are heavily interactive and should remain as Client Components:

1. **`app/messages/page.tsx`**
   - Real-time messaging requires client-side interactivity
   - Keep as Client Component

2. **`app/auth/login/page.tsx`** and **`app/auth/register/page.tsx`**
   - Form handling and validation are client-side concerns
   - Keep as Client Components

3. **`app/listings/create/page.tsx`**
   - Complex form with many interactive elements
   - Keep as Client Component

## Migration Pattern

When migrating a component to a Server Component:

1. **Remove the "use client" directive**
2. **Extract interactive parts** into separate Client Components
3. **Move data fetching** to the Server Component
4. **Pass data as props** to Client Components

### Example: Converting a Component

Before:
\`\`\`tsx
"use client"

import { useState, useEffect } from "react"

export default function ExampleComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setData(data))
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

After:
\`\`\`tsx
// Server Component (ExampleComponent.tsx)
import { InteractiveButton } from "./interactive-button"

async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('/api/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function ExampleComponent() {
  const data = await getData()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
      <InteractiveButton />
    </div>
  )
}

// Client Component (interactive-button.tsx)
"use client"

export function InteractiveButton() {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click Me</button>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Testing Server Components

When testing Server Components:

1. **Ensure proper data fetching** - Server Components should handle their own data fetching
2. **Test with and without JavaScript** - Server Components should work even with JavaScript disabled
3. **Verify SEO benefits** - Check that content is properly indexed by search engines
4. **Monitor performance improvements** - Measure the reduction in JavaScript bundle size
